# ISM_subgrid_clumping
This repository contains a jupyter notebook and data for the statistical subgrid clumping model presented in Buck et al. 2021b. 
Within the notebook, Section "Theoretical model" contains the equations to calculate the cloud scale covering fraction as derived in section 2 and 3 of Buck et al. 2021. 
We accompany this with a little example how to sample valid clumping factors for a given ISM density following Fig. 4 of Buck et al. 2021. 
With this it should be straight forward to employ this model.    

Additionally it contains the plotting routines to recreate all figures from that paper.
In order to recreate all figures, you'll need to get additional large files (>100 Mb) from here: https://datashare.mpcdf.mpg.de/s/iiZs8VFfILThU0h 

If you are using this model or parts of the code or data provided with the jupyter notebook we kindly ask you to cite the corresponding paper as well as acknowledging the original source of the simulation data, the SILCC project (Walch et al. 2015, http://silcc.mpa-garching.mpg.de)
